This webpage lists secondhand stores in Stockholm and employs HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. It also includes an
embedded map using the Google Maps API with labeled markers and infowindows and an email form for users to send comments. 
HTML and Bootstrap were used for the design of the page, CSS was used for the styling, and JavaScript was used for the 
navigation bar, email, and map. EmailJS was also used for the email functionality and Font Awesome was used for icons. 
The project was completed in Gitpod and GitHub was used for version control. 

To test the site test emails were sent and the infowindows on the map were checked.
