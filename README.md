This webpage lists secondhand stores in Stockholm and employs HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. It also includes an
embedded map using the Google Maps API with labeled markers and infowindows and an email form for users to send comments. 
HTML and Bootstrap were used for the design of the page, CSS was used for the styling, and JavaScript was used for the 
navigation bar, email, and map. EmailJS was also used for the email functionality and Font Awesome was used for icons. 
The project was completed in Gitpod and GitHub was used for version control. 

The webpage was designed using responsive design principles and the idea was to make a site with a map which would make 
it easy for people wanting to plan where in Stockholm they would like to go thrift shopping. The markers on the map with 
labels, which correspond to the stores listed below, and infowindows show where the stores are in relation to one another.
The photo is from Pixabay and I wrote the store descriptions. Code from other sources is noted in the files.

To test the site test emails were sent and the infowindows on the map were checked.
